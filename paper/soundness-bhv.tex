%% To prove the converse of \rprop{bhv-completeness}, a naïve proof does not work:
%% suppose given servers $\server$ and $\serverB$, assume $\serverA \asleq \serverB$.
%% We need to prove that, for every client $\client$, if
%% $\musti{\server}{\client}$ then $\musti{\serverA}{\client}$.
%% The reasonable first attempt consisting in proceeding by induction on
%% $\musti{\server}{\client}$ fails, as demonstrated by the following example.

%% \begin{example}
%%   \label{ex:must-set-is-helpful}
%% %  Recall the state $\server$ of \rexa{set-transitions}
%%   Consider the two servers $\server = \tau.(\co{\aa} \Par \co{b}) \extc
%%   \tau.(\co{\aa} \Par \co{c})$ and $\serverB = \co{\aa} \Par (\tau.\co{b} \extc
%%   \tau.\co{c})$ of \req{mailbox-hoisting}.
%%   Fix a client $\client$ such that $\musti{\serverA}{\client}$.
%%   Rule induction %on this fact
%%   yields the following inductive hypothesis:
%%   %on $\musti{\serverA}{\client}   tells us the
%%   \begin{center}
%%     $\forall \serverA', \serverB' \suchthat\;
%%     \csys{\serverA}{\client} \st{\tau} \csys{\serverA'}{\client'} \;\land\;$
%%     $\serverA' \asleq \serverB' \;\Rightarrow\; \musti{\serverB'}{\client'}$.
%%   \end{center}
%%   %% Showing that $\serverA \asleq \serverB$ implies $\serverA \testleqS \serverB$,
%%   %% \ie the soundness direction,
%%   %would among us to pick a client $\client$ such that $\musti{\serverA}{\client}$
%%   %and prove $\musti{\serverB}{\client}$.
%%   In the proof of
%%   $\musti{\serverB}{\client}$ we have to consider the case where there
%%   is a communication between $\serverB$ and
%%   $\client$ such that, for instance, $\serverB \st{\co{\aa}}
%%   \tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$ and $\client \st{\aa}
%%   \client'$.  In that case, we need to show that $ \musti{ \tau.\co{b}
%%     \extc \tau.\co{c}
%%   }{\client'}$. Ideally, we would like to use the inductive
%%   hypothesis. This requires us to exhibit a $\server'$ such that $
%%   \csys{\server}{\client} \st{\tau} \csys{\server'}{\client'}$ and $
%%   \server' \bhvleqtwo \tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$.
%% %\ilacom{What is $\accleqset$? I see now it is defined below.}
%%   However, note that there is no way to derive
%%   $\csys{\server}{\client} \st{\tau} \csys{\server'}{\client'}
%%   $, because $\server
%%   \Nst{\co{\aa}}$.  The inductive hypothesis thus cannot be applied,
%%   and the naïve proof does not go through.\hfill$\qed$
%%   %%% RATIONALE
%%   %% Note that, as~$\opMusti$ is defined on strong transition relations,
%%   %% the inductive hypothesis works \textit{one transition at a time}.
%% \end{example}
%% \noindent
%% This example suggests that defining an auxiliary predicate~$\opMustset$ in some sense
%% equivalent to~$\opMusti$, but that uses explicitly {\em weak} outputs
%% of servers, should be enough to prove that~$\asleq$ is sound wrt~$\testleqS$.
%% Unfortunately, though, there is an additional nuisance to tackle: server
%% non-determinism.
%% \begin{example}
%%   %  Following the intuition outlined thus far,
%%   %% Observe, though, that $ \server \wt{ \co{\aa}}$. This intuition
%%   %% motivates the use of the weak transition $X \wt{\co{\mu}} X'$ in \rfig{rules-mustset}.
%%   %% need for relying on weak transitions instead of strong transitions.
%%   %% To show why the use of sets is necessary,
%%   Assume that we defined the predicate~$\opMusti$
%%   using weak transitions on the server side for the case of
%%   communications. Recall the argument %unfolded
%%   put forward in the previous example.
%%   The inductive hypothesis now becomes the following:
%%   \begin{center}
%%     For every $\serverA', \serverB', \mu$ such that
%%     $\serverA \wt{\mu} \serverA'$ and $\client \st{\mu} \client'$,
%%     $\serverA' \asleq \serverB'$ implies $\musti{\serverB'}{\client'}$.
%%   \end{center}
%%   To use the inductive hypothesis we have to choose a $\server'$ such
%%   that $\server \wt{\co{\aa}} \server'$ and $\server' \asleq
%%   \tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$. This is still not enough for the
%%   entire proof to go through, because (modulo further $\tau$-moves)
%%   the particular $\server'$ we pick has to be related also to either
%%   $\co{b}$ or $\co{c}$. It is not possible to find such a
%%     $\server'$, because
%%     the two possible candidates
%%   %choose such a $\server'$, because the particular $\server'$ we can
%%   %choose
%%   are either $\co{b}$
%%   or $\co{c}$; neither of which can satisfy $\server' \asleq
%%   \tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$, as the right-hand side has not
%%   committed to a branch yet.

%%   %% the server $\tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$ has
%%   %% not commited yet to any branch.%  did not already decide which
%%   %% %  branch it would take.
%%   %% \leo{I think I understand by it's not super clear: is the following correct?
%%   %%   ... the particular $\server'$ we choose will either correspond to $\co{a} \Par \co{b}$
%%   %%   or to $\co{a} \Par \co{c}$; neither of which can satisfy $\server' \asleq
%%   %% \tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$, as the right-hand side has not commited to a
%%   %% branch yet.}

%%   If instead of a single state $\server$ in the novel definition of
%%   $\opMusti$ we used a set of %servers
%%   states and a suitable
%%   transition relation, the choice of either $\co{b}$ or $\co{c}$ will be
%%   suitably delayed. It suffices for instance to have the following states and transitions:
%%   %$X = \set{\co{b}, \co{c}}$ we have that
%%   $\set{\serverA} \wt{\co{\aa}} \set{\co{b}, \co{c}}.$\hfill$\qed$
%%   %and
%% %  $X \asleqset \tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$.
%% %  , for instance $X' =
%% %  \set{\co{b}, \co{c}}$
%%   %% and we defined an LTS such that $X \wt{
%%   %%   \co{\mu}} X'$ then in the proof the choice of either $\co{b}$ or $
%%   %% \co{c}$ would be suitably delayed.
%%   %% %In contrary, the use of sets allows to
%%   %% delay this choice. Indeed, by taking
%%   %% $X = \set{\co{b}, \co{c}}$ we have that $\set{\serverA} \wt{\co{\aa}} X$ and
%%   %% $X \asleqset \tau.\co{b} \extc \tau.\co{c}$.\hfill$\qed$
%% \end{example}

%% Now that we have motivated the main intuitions behind the definition of our
%% novel auxiliary predicate~$\opMustset$, we proceed with the formal definitions.

%% {\bfseries The LTS of sets.}
%% Let~$\pparts{ Z }$ be the set of  {\em non-empty} parts of~$Z$.
%% Given an LTS~$\lts{\States}{ L }{ \st{} }$, we define
%% for every $ X \in \pparts{ \States } $ and every $\alpha$ the set
%% $D{(\alpha, X)} = \setof{ \stateA }{ \exists \state \in X \suchthat \state \st{\alpha} \stateA }$
%% \pl{and $\WD{(\alpha, X)} = \setof{ \stateA }{ \exists \state \in X \suchthat \state \wt{\alpha} \stateA }$}.
%% Essentially we lift the standard notion of state derivative to sets of states.
%% We construct the LTS $\lts{\pparts{ \States }}{ \Acttau }{ \st{} }$
%% by letting $ X \st{ \alpha } D{(\alpha, X)}$ whenever $D{(\alpha, X)} \neq \emptyset$.
%% \pl{Similarly, we have $X \wt{ \alpha } \WD{(\alpha, X)}$ whenever $\WD{(\alpha, X)} \neq \emptyset$}.
%% %, \ie whenever
%% %and there exists a $\server \in X$ such that $\server \st{ \alpha }$.

\leaveout{
\begin{example}
  \label{ex:set-transitions}
    Let $\server = \tau.(\co{\aa} \Par \co{b}) \extc \tau.(\co{\aa} \Par \co{c})$.
    We have
    $$
    \begin{array}{l}

    \hfill$\qed$
  \end{example}
  In our arguments we will reason on the fact for a given $X \in \pparts{ \States }$
  all the states $p \in X$ must pass a given client $r$.
  The predicate $\opMusti$ is not directly usable to this aim, because
  in general $ \musti{X}{\client} $ does not imply that $\forall
  \server \musti{X}{\client}$. We show this in the next example.
  \begin{example}
    \label{ex:musti-not-directly-liftable-LTS-of-sets}
    Let $X = \set{\Nil, \co{\aa}}$ and $\client = \aa.\Unit$.
    We have that $\musti{X}{\client}$, because $X \st{\co{\aa}}$ and $X
    \st{\co{\aa}} Y$ implies that $Y = \set{ \Nil }$  and
    $$
    \begin{prooftree}
      {\good{\Unit}}
      \justifies
          {\begin{prooftree}
              \musti{\Nil}{\Unit}
              \justifies
                  { \musti{ \set{\Nil, \co{\aa}} }{\aa.\Unit} }
            \end{prooftree}%
          }
    \end{prooftree}
    $$
    On the other hand $\Nil \in X$  and $\Nmusti{\Nil}{\client}
    $.\hfill$\qed$
  \end{example}
%%   It seems natural that a server $\server$ and the singleton

%% \begin{proof}
%% We proceed by rule induction on the derivation of the hypothesis $\mustset{X}{\client}$.

%% In the base case, $\mustset{X}{\client}$ has been derived using the rule \msetnow
%% such that $\good{\client}$ and $\musti{\server}{\client}$ follows from

%% %
%% %
%% In the inductive case $\mustset{X}{\client}$ has been derived using

%%   and $\client \st{\mu} \client'$ imply that $\mustset{ X' }{ \client'}$
%% \end{enumerate}

%% Pick a $\server \in X$.
%% Since $\lnot \good{\client}$ and thanks to
%% (\ref{musti-if-mustset-helper-h1}), to show

%% %%\end{enumerate}
%% %The first requirement is a direct consequence of (\ref{musti-if-mustset-helper-h0}).
%% %% The first requirement follows from the fact that $\serverA \in X$ together with
%% %% (\ref{musti-if-mustset-helper-h1}).
%% %%To show the third requirement
%% Fix a silent transition $\csys{\serverA}{\client} \st{\tau} \csys{\serverA'}{\client'}$. We proceed by case analysis on how the transition
%% $\csys{\serverA}{\client} \st{\tau} \csys{\serverA'}{\client'}$ has been derived.
%% There are three cases, either the transition has been derived. There are the three following cases.
%% \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
%% \item[\stauserver]
%%   a $\tau$-transition performed by the server such that $\serverA \st{\tau} \serverA'$
%%   and that $\client' = \client$, or

%%   an interaction between the server $\serverA$ and the client $\client$ such that
%%   $\serverA \st{\mu} \serverA'$ and $\client \st{\co{\mu}} \client'$.

%% \TODO{What does the inductive hypothesis state ?}

%% In case \stauserver we apply the inductive hypothesis. To do so we

%% We take $X' = \setof{\hat{\server}}{\serverA \st{\tau} \hat{\server}}$.
%% As $\serverA \st{\tau} \serverA'$, it must be the case that $\serverA' \in X'$ and we are done.
%% In case \stauclient, then conclusion is a direct consequence of the inductive hypothesis.
%% The argument for case \scom is similar to the one for case

%% \begin{proof}
%%   We first prove \rptlem{bhvleqtwo-preserved}{bhvleqtwo-preserved-by-tau}.

%%   requires us to show $X \cnvalong \mu.\trace$ which follows

%% \begin{proof}
%%   We show that assuming $X \asleqset \serverB$ leads to a contradiction and thus a derivation of $\bot$.

%%   An application of $X \accleqset q$ with $\trace = \varepsilon$, $\stateB' = \stateB$,
%%   and (\ref{stability-Nbhvleqtwo-h1}) gives us a $\serverA'$ such that
%%   $\serverA \wt{\varepsilon} \serverA' \stable$ and $O(\serverA') \subseteq O(\serverB)$.
%%   An application of $\mustset{X}{\client}$, \rlem{wt-nil-mx} and \rlem{mx-sub} ensures that
%%   $\mustset{\set{\serverA'}}{\client}$.
%%   As $\lnot \good{\client}$, it must be the case that $\mustset{\set{\serverA'}}{\client}$
%%   is derived using the rule \mstep which implies that $\csys{\serverA'}{\client} \st{\tau}$.
%%   We contine with a case analysis on how this transition has been derived.
%%   As $\serverA'$ is stable, and from (\ref{stability-Nbhvleqtwo-h2}) we know that
%%   it must be derived using \rname{s-com} such that
%%   $\serverA' \st{\mu}$ and $\client \st{\co{\mu}}$ for some $\mu \in \Act$.
%%   Finally, we distinguish whether $\mu$ is an input or an output.
%%   In the first case $\mu$ is an input.
%%   From $O(\serverA') \subseteq O(\serverB)$ it must be the case that $\serverB \st{\co{\mu}}$
%%   holds, which contradicts the hypothesis that $\csys{\serverB}{\client} \stable$.
%%   In the second case $\mu$ is an output.
%%   As $\serverB$ is $\obaFW$, we can apply the axiom for forwarders and get a server $\stateB'$
%%   such that $\serverB \st{\co{\mu}}$. This implies the existence of a communication
%%   between $\serverB$ and $\client$, which contradicts
%%   the hypothesis that $\csys{\serverB}{\client} \stable$ and lets us conclude this case.

The main technical work for the proof of soundness is carried out by the next lemma.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:soundness-set}
  Let $\genlts_\StatesA, \genlts_\StatesB \in \obaFW$ and
  $\genlts_\StatesC \in \obaFB$.
  For every set of servers $X \in \pparts{ \StatesA }$,
  server $\serverB \in \StatesB$ and client $\client \in \StatesC$,
  if $\mustset{X}{\client}$ and $X \asleqset \serverB$ then $\musti{\serverB}{\client}$.
\end{lemma}



\begin{proposition}[Soundness]
  \label{prop:bhv-soundness}
  For every $\genlts_A, \genlts_B \in \obaFB$ and
  servers $\serverA \in \StatesA, \serverB \in \StatesB $,
  if $\liftFW{ \serverA } \asleq \liftFW{ \serverB }$ then $\serverA \testleqS \serverB$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Point (2) of \rlem{musti-obafb-iff-musti-obafw} ensures that the result follows if we prove that
$\liftFW{\serverA} \testleqS \liftFW{\serverB}.$
Fix a client $\client$ such that $\musti{\liftFW{\serverA}}{\client}$.
\rlem{soundness-set} implies the required
$\musti{\liftFW{\serverB}}{\client}$, if we show that
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item $\mustset{ \set{ \liftFW{\serverA} } }{ \client }$, and that
  \item $\set{ \liftFW{ \serverA } } \mathrel{\preccurlyeq^{\mathsf{set}}_{\mathsf{AS}}} \liftFW{\serverB}$.
\end{enumerate}
The first fact follows from the assumption that $\musti{\liftFW{\serverA}}{\client}$
and \rlem{musti-if-mustset-helper} applied to the singleton
$\set{\liftFW{\serverA}}$.
The second fact follows from the hypothesis that $\liftFW{ \serverA }
\asleq \liftFW{ \serverB }$ and \rlem{alt-set-singleton-iff}.\qed
%%%% ORIGINAL PROOF
  %% Fix a client $\client$ such that $\musti{\liftFW{\serverA}}{\client}$.
  %% The required $\musti{\liftFW{\serverB}}{\client}$ follows from
  %% \rlem{soundness-set}, if we show that
  %% $\set{\serverA} \asleq \serverB$.
  %% We obtain $\set{\serverA} \asleq \serverB$ by
  %% an application of \rlem{alt-set-singleton-iff} in the hypothesis $\serverA \asleq \serverB$.
  %% The requirement $\musti{\set{\liftFW{\serverA}}}{\client}$ is a consequence of
  %% an application of \rlem{musti-equals-mustset} together with the hypothesis that
  %% $\musti{\liftFW{\serverA}}{\client}$.
